**Description**
FitnessApp is a web application that helps users find fitness-related videos quickly and efficiently. It features a powerful search bar with suggestions and uses API calls to fetch relevant data with every keystroke, while also utilizing debouncing to optimize performance. Additionally, the app intelligently stores suggestions in a cache using Redux, reducing unnecessary API calls and making the search process more efficient.

# Features
**Dynamic Search Bar**: The app includes a search bar that dynamically suggests results as users type. This provides a user-friendly search experience.

**API Integration**: FitnessApp makes API calls with every keystroke to fetch data matching the search query. This ensures that users always have access to the most up-to-date fitness content.

**Debouncing**: To optimize performance and prevent excessive API calls, the app utilizes debouncing. This means that API requests are made only after a short delay since the user's last keystroke.

**Cache Management**: Suggestions generated by the search bar are stored in a Redux store, effectively reducing the number of API calls. This enhances the app's efficiency and responsiveness.

**Result Cards**: The search results are presented in visually appealing cards. Each card displays the matching video, a query heading, and relevant tags, allowing users to easily identify and access the content they need.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
